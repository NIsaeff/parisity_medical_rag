/**
 * Vector search over the clinical notes — Week 2, built together in class.
 *
 * The shape we're building, two-stage retrieval in one call:
 *   1. embed the query, ask Pinecone for the nearest topK notes (wide, cheap)
 *   2. rerank those candidates against the query, keep topN (narrow, careful)
 *
 * Returns both lists so you can log them side by side and SEE what reranking
 * changed on a given query.
